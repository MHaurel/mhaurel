### Hi there / Bonjour 👋

Proud to be a **french** student

- My real aim is to work on applied AI in the fields of medecine, neuroscience, etc.

> HOBBIES & INTERESTS 🌌

- Astronomy & Cosmology

> SKILLS 🐳

- For 3 years now, I started developing my own projects (and sometimes never finishing those...) and it trained me for sure to acquire a solid logic on how to solve problems.
- I centered my training on Python and a bit of Web development but my current train is aimed on learning and understanding most of the most used machine learning algorihms (random forest, logistic regression, linear regression).
