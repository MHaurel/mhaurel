### Hi there / Bonjour 👋

Proud to be a **french** student, proud to be **me**

> EDUCATION 🧑🏻‍🏫

- I'm currently enrolled in a Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Human and Social Sciences specialized in Cognitive Sciences BSc.
- My real aim is advanced AI (Deep Learning) and its applications to concrete world problems and that's why I'm heading towards a NLP or Cognitive Sciences MSc. starting from the next year.

> HOBBIES & INTERESTS 🌌

- Besides my education, I feel really amazed by the astronomy and cosmology fields. My true dream is to work one day on some concreate AI - astro related problems.
- I've played Soccer (Football) and Badminton for a total of 12 years and it trained me for sure to keep my focus even in hard times

> SKILLS 🐳

- For 3 years now, I started developing my own projects (and sometimes never finishing those...) and it trained me for sure to acquire a solid logic on how to solve problems.
- I centered my training on Python and a bit of Web development but my current train is aimed on learning and understanding most of the most used machine learning algorihms (random forest, logistic regression, linear regression).
